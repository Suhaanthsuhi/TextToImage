# Image Generation with Stable Diffusion and GPT-3

## Overview

This project demonstrates the generation of images based on textual prompts using Stable Diffusion and GPT-3. Stable Diffusion is a technique for generating high-quality images by iteratively refining a noise tensor. GPT-3, on the other hand, is a state-of-the-art language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

## Libraries Used

- `pathlib`: A library for handling file paths.
- `tqdm`: A library for displaying progress bars during iterative processes.
- `torch`: PyTorch, a deep learning framework.
- `pandas`: A data manipulation library.
- `numpy`: A library for numerical computing.
- `diffusers`: A library for Stable Diffusion image generation.
- `transformers`: A library for natural language processing tasks, including interaction with GPT-3.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: A library for creating visualizations.
- `cv2`: OpenCV, a library for computer vision tasks.

## Configuration (CFG)

- `device`: Specifies the device to run computations on (e.g., "cuda" for GPU).
- `seed`: Seed value for random number generation.
- `generator`: PyTorch generator initialized with the specified seed.
- `image_gen_steps`: Number of steps for image generation.
- `image_gen_model_id`: Identifier for the Stable Diffusion model.
- `image_gen_size`: Size of the generated image.
- `image_gen_guidance_scale`: Scale for guiding image generation.
- `prompt_gen_model_id`: Identifier for the GPT-3 model.
- `prompt_dataset_size`: Size of the dataset for generating prompts.
- `prompt_max_length`: Maximum length of generated prompts.

## Image Generation

The `generate_image` function takes a textual prompt and a model as input and generates an image based on the prompt using the Stable Diffusion technique.

## Usage

1. Set up the configuration parameters in the `CFG` class according to your requirements.
2. Call the `generate_image` function with the desired prompt and model to generate an image.
